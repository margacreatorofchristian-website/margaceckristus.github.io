CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights upon the creator and subsequent owner of an original work of authorship. Certain owners of those rights wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their work in part through the use and efforts of others.
For these and or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a work hereby voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the work and publicly distribute the work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
1. Copyright and Related Rights.
A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights. These rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work; ii. moral rights retained by the original author and or performer; iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work; vi. database rights, whether sui generis or otherwise; and vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver.
To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, the person associating CC0 with a Work hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, whether now known or unknown, in all territories worldwide, for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty. The person associating CC0 with the Work makes the waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of the waiving party's heirs and successors. The person associating CC0 with a Work intends this waiver to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to this Work under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, including moral rights, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
3. Public License Fallback.
Should any part of the waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account the person's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the waiver is so judged the person associating CC0 with a Work hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise the person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work in any way whatsoever, including without limitation commercial purposes, and in all territories worldwide, for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
a. No trademark or patent rights held by the person associating CC0 with the Work are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. b. The person associating CC0 with the Work offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. c. The person associating CC0 with the Work disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, the person disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. d. The person associating CC0 with the Work understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
